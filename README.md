Course: CSCI-331 DATABASE SYSTEMS



---------------------------------------------------------------
Goal and Motivation:
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is project 1 for CSCI 331. We provided every file we worked on, separated per person except the GANTT chart and
TODO list(IN TIME_MANAGEMENT, which every member each adhered to. Our leader, Fahim, helped with direction
(using the chart and list along with frequent communication). 

We separated each tasks into pairs:
PAIR 1(FAHIM AND YOUSUF)
PAIR 2(SAYANTAN AND JUSTIN)
And Esfar did the project solo. 

We also wanted to adhere to the feedback from previous assignments, so we tried to implemented clearly code which showcased the proper outputs when ran. 
Also this repository is designed to be more organized to separate individual files and files used for coordination(TodoList and GAANT chart).

For the pairs, we solved each mystery our partner produced and collaborated using video call and SQL tools(Azure Data Studio, SQL Management Studio and Dbeaver) to create 3-4 queries to solve each one. 

For walkthroughs, we uploaded each on youtube:
